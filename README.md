test
====

test code was originally for an automated pull. but it
has been modified to be a general purpose test for 
git functions.

it might be modified going forward to do more testing.


### usage

pass in integers and the max value will be printed:
```
$ ./test.py 1 4 6 3 5 19 2
19
```

use the `--sum` argument to add the integers:
```
$ ./test.py --sum 1 4 6 3 5 19 2
40
```
